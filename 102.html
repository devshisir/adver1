                     </div>
                     <div class="takeawyItem">
                        <h4><span>(ONE)</span> - TRUSTWORTHINESS</h4>
                        <p>Step one of any online encounter begins with <span class="underLine">trust</span> . Heck, it’s the reason that platforms were designed the way they are - to avoid the vagueness (& creepiness) too many people get from that first-date experience. </p>
                        <p>The only trouble is -  now - more & more people have gotten used to that painfully awkward meeting (which is a good thing!)</p>
                        <p>However, this means that deeper concerns are appearing quicker than ever in the dating-sphere, and there’s a good reason why…</p>
                        <p>“A high credit score can help predict whether someone is <br> <span class="bold">trustworthy”</span>, say’s Quentin Fottrell of MarketWatch.<span class="noteNumber">3</span></p>
                        <div class="imageBox4 text-center">
                           <img class="img-fluid" src="asset/img/3.png" alt="advertismet image">
                        </div>
                        <p>That “trust” ties back into every single factor of a long term relationship - from fidelity to finances… </p>
                        <div class="quoteBox4">
                           <p>About 30% of women and 20% of men say they won't marry a person with a low credit score, according to a new survey from FreeCreditScore.com that polled 1,000 adults.<span class="noteNumber">4</span></p>
                        </div>
                        <p>Still, that doesn’t mean your Credit Score is a good icebreaker!</p>
                        <p>As Robin Frankel reminds readers of Bankrate.com, “only 6 percent of respondents say it’s something that should be shared within the first few dates.”<span class="noteNumber">5</span></p>
                        <p>But at the end of the day, knowing that financial institutions trust your judgement can go a long way with someone who is essentially a stranger. </p>
                        <p><span class="bold underLine">TAKE AWAY:</span> Even if your score isn’t ‘phenomenal’, being upfront with your partner can help create a solid foundation that other factors just can’t. </p>

                        <p>Again, there is plenty of room for the causal-dating scene on today’s platforms! In fact, some are designed specifically for...intimate encounters only…</p>
                        <p>But for those swiping-right for something more meaningful, there are big reasons to take Credit Score into account from the outset.</p>
                        <p>In a joint study, researchers at UCLA, the Brookings Institution and Federal Reserve Board, report that:</p>
                        <div class="quoteBox5">
                           <p>“Initial <span class="underLine">credit scores</span> and <span class="underLine">match quality</span> predict subsequent <span class="bold">credit usage & financial distress,</span> which in turn are correlated with relationship dissolution.” They also wrote. “Credit scores reveal an individual’s relationship skill and level of commitment.” <span class="noteNumber">6</span></p>
                        </div>
                        <p>Which is a fancy way of saying - if you don’t have your sh*t together now, how can a new partner expect you to be there in the long-run?</p>

                        <p>And to be clear, that’s not just the observation of users like Madeline…</p>
                        <p>A recent article by BusinessInsider reported that for 58% of online daters, <span class="underLine">a good credit score is more attractive than a nice car.</span> </p>
                        <p>And half of those surveyed prefer a partner to have a good credit score over an impressive job title, with <span class="bold">40% taking a good credit score over a physically fit body.<span class="noteNumber">8</span></span></p>

                        <p>Well NYC writer, John Schmidt would beg to disagree:</p>

                           <p>“To keep it simple, I erased every bit of personality and mention of breakfast tacos from my Tinder profile, leaving just my most photogenic pictures and a mention of my ‘very good’ FICO score...

                        </div>
                        <p>Some have even taken this to the extreme, like the website creditscoredating.com which factors those 3 little numbers into every match they make! </p>

                        <p>And whether we like it or not, a Credit Score is one of the most quickly accessible pieces of financial information about ourselves.</p>

                        <p>And whether you’re looking for love or not, there are some pretty obvious tips that pop up on almost every advice article when it comes to improving your credit. </p>
                        <ul>
                           <li>Set up automatic payments.</li>
                           <li>Pay down big bills if you can dip into savings.</li>
                           <li>Use one credit-card for essentials & pay it off every month.</li>

                        <p>In fact, another woman we interviewed for this article, Alison Hilton, was able to take her credit score from 588 to 781 <span class="underLine">in only 90 days…</span></p>
                        <p>“I honestly got a little nervous...” she says. “I was worried I’d misreported something or that the banks had made a mistake, but it turns out I was in the clear!”</p>
                        <p>That’s because Alison had taken the time to learn the fuller picture of her credit…</p>
                        <p>She even discovered that there was misreported credit on her record! </p>
                        <p>If that sounds surprising, it shouldn’t...</p>
