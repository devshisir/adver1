                              <p style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-style: normal">(San Diego, CA)</span> - “I know dating can be awkward”, said David, “but I gotta tell ya, I wasn’t expecting to see THAT kind of picture with a bunch of question marks… especially at 9am on a Tuesday.”</p>
                              <p>As he showed me his dating site inbox, I saw an image that's becoming more and more common for new & potential partners to send one another. </p>
                              <p>It’s deeply private, possibly embarrassing, and has nothing to do with intimacy…</p>

                  <div class="item">
                     <p>I’m talking, of course, about your credit-score.</p>
                     <p style="font-style: italic;">“Honestly, it was the way she did it so casually. I knew she owned a home (I rent), but we’d talked about hopes for the future on the first date & then BOOM!”</p>
                     <p>Unfortunately for David, he was part of the 40% of people who don’t know their credit score.</p>
                     <p>I have student loans & credit card debt. I usually just keep my head down. I hadn’t checked my credit score in years!”</p>
                     <p>But David, and so many other singles, are discovering that size matters - and not in the vain way it once did… </p>
                     <p>After surveying over 2000 people on their platform, Match Media Group found that:</p>
                     <div class="quoteBox">
                        <h5>“Half of those surveyed prefer a partner to have a good credit score over an impressive job title, and 40% took the credit score over a physically fit body.”</h5>
                     </div>
                     <p>So David (by no means a bad-looking guy) bit the bullet & decided to check his scores…</p>
                     <p style="font-style: italic;">“When I saw them showing 594, I was devastated! I know it wasn’t perfect, but I never knew it was that bad.”</p>
                     <p>He laughs as he tells the story, but David was right to be concerned at the time… for more than just financial reasons…</p>
                     <p>Being newly single, and looking for Ms. Right… he knew he had to do something about this - and do it fast.</p>
                     <p>So he did what so many in his situation do when looking for advice…</p>
                     <p>He got on YouTube.</p>
                     <p style="font-style: italic;">“Look, the only thing worse than dealing with finances is learning about finances,” David tells me,</p>
                     <p style="font-style: italic;">“...which is why I figured I’d have someone teach me instead of trying to figure it all out on my own…”</p>
                     <p>What David found at first though, was a lot of advice he <span class="bold">couldn’t</span> stomach.</p>
                     <p>He did not want to use his savings to pay down some of his credit cards.</p>
                     <p>He did not need a new car or have a house to refinance.</p>
                     <p>And there was almost nothing he could do about his student debt that didn’t seem like it would take more time than it was worth…</p>
                     <p style="font-style: italic;">“But, after a couple of days of just letting videos auto-play in the background, I finally heard <a href="#">one that caught my attention…</a>”</p>
                     <p>Like a lot of us, David didn’t know it was possible to have completely misreported items sitting on your credit reports. And these items can drop your scores dramatically.</p>
                     <p style="font-style: italic;">“When I found out about <a href="#">this credit score loophole</a>, I realized there were a lot of easy fixes - just hidden in plain sight... I can’t believe no one ever told me about this!”</p>
                     <p>About a week after our interview, a friend showed me <a href="#">the exact same video</a> David found.</p>
                     <p>Granted, she’s married with two kids, so her priorities were a little different! </p>
                     <p>But it was weird these two people - a stranger & a close friend - we’re both so impressed with the results of this advice.</p>
                     <p>So I finally decided to <a href="#">watch it</a> for myself.</p>
                     <p>And after seeing the loophole revealed inside, <a href="#">I strongly recommend that you do, too…</a></p>
                     <p>Because, I’ve probably seen all of the same “tips & tricks” articles you have about how to raise your scores... </p>
                     <p>But, even though things like setting up automatic payments or even using one credit card for essentials can be helpful…</p>
                     <p>They won't get you the kind of <a href="#">fast score jumps this will</a>.</p>
                     <p>And chances are, if you’re looking for love, patience is a tricky emotion to come by…</p>
                     <p>But before you dip into your emergency fund to pay off a credit card so you can brag for swipes, take a second & watch this <a href="#">short video now</a>.</p>
