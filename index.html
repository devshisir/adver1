                     <p>… and it isn’t just a band-aid solution!</p>
                     <p>It may not shock you, but what most people don’t know is that credit card companies & big banks make a huge amount of cash off tiny percentages.</p>
                     <p>And recently, many companies have begun slashing credit lines or simply canceling cards altogether.</p>
                     <p>They’re guaranteeing their profits in spite of <a href="#">the law of big numbers.</a></p>
                     <p>And they know it.</p>
                     <div class="quoteBox">
                        <h5>"The last thing you want is to have a potential safety net like a credit card yanked out from under you without any of your doing," said Matt Schulz of LendingTree. "Credit cardholders of all types are having this happen to them."<span>1</span></h5>
                     </div>
                     <p>Over the years, credit companies have created some of the densest legal documents imaginable.</p>
                     <p>Then count on everyone playing by the rules...because they made them!</p>
                     <p>But the best part of this deal is that when they make a “mistake”, they too have to play by the same ‘rules’. And there is a simple, quick trick that they don’t want you to know about.</p>
                     <p>When set into motion, some consumers are seeing their credit scores jump 50 to 100 points almost instantly. </p>
                     <p>One California mom - Alison Hilton - was able to raise her credit score from 588 to a whopping 781 <span class="underLine">in only 90 days…</span></p>
                     <p>“I honestly got a little nervous...” she says. “I was worried I’d misreported something or that the banks had made a mistake, but it turns out I was in the clear!”</p>
                     <p>That's because this proven method is built on the <span class="underLine">consumer protection processes</span> that credit lenders are <span class="underLine">legally obligated</span> to follow.</p>
                     <p>Once enacted, <span class="underLine">they have to uphold their end of the bargain,</span> no matter what your current situation is…</p>
                     <p>And right now, there has never been a better time to make sure you & your family have <span class="bold">the safety-net that you’ve earned.</span></p>
                     <p>Because of the chaos during these last months, a lot of focus has shifted away from everyday consumers to what’s happening on Wall Street…</p>
                     <p>Still, that hasn’t stopped experts from trying to get the word out about this blueprint for financial success! </p>
                     <p>...even if they get buried in the 2AM slot on cable-news.</p>
                     <p>But a viral-video that puts the pieces together has recently surfaced (& been pulled down several times!) that is scaring the credit industry to its core.</p>
                     <p>We don’t know how much longer it can remain up.</p>
                     <p>But we think it’s about time that you learned the truth about how to free yourself from the collection calls & start building your credit back to what it actually should be! </p>
